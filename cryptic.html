  <h3>Tutorial</h3>
  <p>Cryptic crosswords are very different than regular crosswords. Each clue contains two parts: a definition, which is like a regular clue, hinting at the answer, and a word puzzle, which will give you the answer when solved, matching with the definition. Here's an example.</p>
  <p>Blade of wild words (5)</p>
  <p>The first step is finding the definition and the word puzzle. The definition is always either at the very front or the very end of the clue, in order to make it easier to find. In this case, "blade" is the definition, and "wild words" is the word puzzle.</p>
  <p>Here's how this word puzzle gives the answer. "Wild" implies going insane and mixing things up. This means we have to mix up "words", which gives "sword". This is called an <b>anagram</b>. "Sword" matches the definition of "blade", and so it is the answer.</p>
  <p>Not all clues work like this, but most are similar. Some may involve adding or deleting letters, putting two words together, or even reversing entire words. Others use double or triple meanings. Most importantly, not all clues will give you the word you need to modify, like "words" in the last example; it may be a synonym instead.</p>
