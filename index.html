  <h1>Welcome to the Website</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>The website is currently in the developing stages and is receiving an overhaul. Currently is doesn't have much. More coming soon.</p>

  <h3>Weekly Puzzles</h3>
  <p>I found making a Daily Crossword a little too difficult, so I am replacing it with some weekly puzzles. They are not currently available because I don't want to code them. Currently the pages are only half-working, but you can find them in the navigation bar.</a></p>

  <h3>Updates</h3>
  <p>New games! Now you can play the mini, cryptic, midi, and ladder every week! Connections will be finished when I figure out how to use CSS better.</p>
