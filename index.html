  <h3>Updates</h3>
  <p>The Daily Crossword has been added to the website! The first crossword will appear on Monday, June 17th for you guys to solve. Currently, the CSS is not doing nice things, so the clues might look a little weird on certain screen sizes. Hopefully I will know what I'm doing soon. If you want to try the crossword out, the link can be found above.</p>

  <h3>Our Story</h3>
  <p>The Website was born from the brain of a young grade 10 student who had a random idea one day to make his own Wikipedia type thing. He decided to make some webpages and his long term goal was to write about everything in the entire universe. This is not likely to happen.</p>
