  <h3>What Just Happened?</h3>
  <p>Once upon a time, there was an electronic device. This electronic device happens to be the one you are currently reading this text on. This electronic device sent a signal far across the Internet to a web server. It asked the web server to send it a certain page of Wikipedia Plus. Alas, the web server searched and searched for the page, but it did not have it anywhere in it's files. So, it sent back a 404 error code and the webpage you are currently reading. The end.</p>
