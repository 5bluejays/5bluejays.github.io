  <h1>Prime Numbers</h1>
  <hr>

  <p>Difficulty - Grade 7</p>
  
  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>Division is one of the most common operations in math. All numbers can be divided, but the result is not always nice. For example, 10 / 5 = 2, and 2 is a nice result. However, 7 / 3 = 2.3333333... This is not a nice result. A number is considered <b>divisible</b> by another number if it can be divided by that number and give a nice result</p>
  <p>A prime number is a number than is not divisible by anything (except itself and one).</p>
  <p>The first six prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. These numbers cannot be divided by another number to get a nice answer (unless they are divided by themselves or one). There are infinitely many prime numbers; this was proven by Euclid, a famous mathematician. How many can you find?</p>



  <h3>Finding Primes</h3>
  <p>Finding prime numbers can be very interesting, because they don't follow a pattern. There is no formula to create a list of all the prime numbers. In order to find a prime number, you just have make a guess and see if it is right. Thankfully, there are some useful rules that can help find primes.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>All primes numbers are odd (except 2), because every even number is divisible by 2</li>
    <li>No prime numbers end with a 5 or a 0, because that would make them divisible by 5</li>
    <li>This means every prime numbers ends with a 1, 3, 7, or 9</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These are only the basics of finding prime numbers, as some mathematicians have taken this to the extreme. People have make programs</p>
