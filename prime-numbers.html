  <h1>Prime Numbers</h1>
  <hr>

  <p>Difficulty - Grade 7</p>
  
  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>Division is one of the most common operations in math. All numbers can be divided, but the result is not always nice. For example, 10 / 5 = 2, and 2 is a nice result. However, 7 / 3 = 2.3333333 . . . this is not a nice result. A number is considered <b>divisible</b> by another number if it can be divided by that number and give a nice result</p>
  <p>A prime number is a number than is not divisible by anything (except itself and one).</p>
  <p>The first six prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. These numbers cannot be divided by another number to get a nice answer (unless they are divided by themselves or one). There are infinitely many prime numbers; this was proven by Euclid, a famous mathematician. How many can you find?</p>



  <h3>Finding Primes</h3>
  <p>Finding prime numbers can be very interesting, because they don't follow a pattern. There is no formula to create a list of all the prime numbers. In order to find a prime number, you just have make a guess and see if it is right. Thankfully, there are some useful rules that can help find primes.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>All primes numbers are odd (except 2), because every even number is divisible by 2</li>
    <li>No prime numbers end with a 5 or a 0, because that would make them divisible by 5</li>
    <li>This means every prime number ends with a 1, 3, 7, or 9</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These are only the basics of finding prime numbers. Some mathematicians and computer experts have taken this to the extreme and tried to find the largest prime numbers they possibly could. The tricky thing is that primes become rarer as they get larger, because larger numbers are more likely to be divisible by something. As of May 2024, the largest known prime number is</p>
  <p style="word-break: break-all;">148894445742041325547806458472397916603026273992795324185271289425213239361064475310309971132180337174752834401423587560 . . .</p>
  <p>Well, those are the first 120 digits. The number itself is more than 24 000 000 digits in length! If you want to see the number in full, you can purchase the 400 page book off Amazon at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Worlds-Largest-Prime-Number-Smallest/dp/1798858525" target="_blank">this link</a>. I might buy it sometime soon.</p>



  <h3>Prime Factorization</h3>
  <p>One very interesting property of prime numbers is that they are the foundation of other numbers. Every <b>composite</b> (not prime) number can be written as the product of other prime numbers. Take 8 as an example. 8 is exactly the same as 2×4. 2 is prime, but 4 is not. 4 can be written as 2×2, both of which are prime. This means that 8 can be written as 2×2×2, or 2³, which is known as its <b>prime factorization</b>.</p>

  <p>Every number has a prime factorization, and some are more special than others. 8 just so happens to be a special one, because it's prime factors are all the same. See if you can find some interesting prime factorizations.</p>


  
  <h3>Twin Primes</h3>
  <p>Twin primes consist of two primes seperated by only one even number. Examples of twin primes are 3 and 5, 11 and 13, and even 347 and 349. Many mathematicians have guessed that there are infinitely many twin primes. This may seem like a simple idea, but <b>nobody has ever been able to prove it</b>. Currently called the <b>twin prime conjucture</b>, it is one of the most important problems in all of mathematics. Do you think you could prove it?</p>
