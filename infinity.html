  <h1>Infinity</h1>
  <hr>

  <p>Difficulty - Grade 7</p>
  
  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>Most people believe that infinity is the largest number. This is <b>wrong</b>. There is no largest number, because you can always add one to it, making it larger. If you count up from one and so on forever, you will not eventually reach infinity, because infinity is <b>not a number</b>. Infinity is a <b>size</b>. A better way of understanding it is to think about the following equation.</p>
  <p>1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + . . . (forever)</p>
  <p>What is the sum? Well, if you think about it, adding up all these numbers means that the sum will grow bigger and bigger the more numbers you add. Because the sum is constantly getting larger, we say that the sum is infinity, an endless size. We call something infinity if it is constantly getting larger and larger.</p>

  <h3>Infinity Plus One</h3>
  <p>What happens when we treat infinity like a number and add one to it? What happens?</p>
  <p>∞ + 1 = ???</p>
  <p>One way to find the answer is to use an analogy called the <b>Hilbert Hotel</b>. The Hilbert Hotel is a hotel with only one floor, and it has an infinite number of rooms going down a single hallway. The first room is Room 1, the second room is Room 2, and so on forever. Imagine that the entire hotel is completely full; there is a person in every single room. However, another person has just shown up at the door and wants to book a room. Can we fit them in the hotel?</p>
  <p>It turns out that the answer is <b>yes</b>. Think about it for a moment and see if you can figure it out. The solution is to get everybody to move up one room. The person in Room 1 moves to Room 2, the person in Room 2 moves to Room 3, and so on forever. This will make Room 1 available. What this means is that infinity people plus one person is still infinity people; there are still an infinite number of people in the hotel.</p>
  <p>∞ + 1 = ∞</p>

  <h3>Infinitesimal</h3>
  <p>What happens when you take a number, like 1, for example, and divide it into an infinite number of parts? How large is each part? Think about it for a moment.</p>
  <p>1 / ∞</p>
  <p>First of all, it is important to notice that answer is not zero. Here's why: if you take a pie and cut it into an infinite number of pieces, and each piece is zero, you cannot reassemble the pie back to how it was because none of the pieces exist. This is an impossible scenario, so it means that 1 / ∞ is greater than zero. But how much greater? It is greater by an infinitely small amount. We call this inifnitely small amount the <b>infinitesimal</b>. It turns out that the infinitesimal is actually very useful in calculus.</p>
